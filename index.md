## Dynamic Screen Clipper

When is multitasking not fun? Imagine watching a youtube video, studying for the pesky quiz on the next day, chatting.....all at ONCE.
This dynamic screen clipper allows the user to clip certain portions of an application and display it as he/she wishes on their screen.
You can also work on these mini applications, thereby redefining the word 'multitasking'.
